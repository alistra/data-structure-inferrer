For now you can get the best structures depending on operations used in your program (if you manually put it in the invocation):

*AllStructures> recommendAllDs [InsertVal, ExtremalVal]
[Fibonacci Heap,Binomial Heap]
*AllStructures> recommendAllDs [InsertVal, FindByVal ]
[Hashtable]
*AllStructures> recommendAllDs [InsertVal, FindByVal, ExtremalVal]  
[Red-Black Trees]

*Advice> printAdvice [InsertVal, UpdateByVal, DeleteExtremalVal ]
Currently recommended data structure is: Red-Black Trees
You could use Hashtable, if you removed the following operations:
* DeleteExtremalVal
