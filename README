For now you can sort the structures by relevance depending on operations used in your program (if you manually put it in the invocation):

*AllStructures> recommendAllDS [InsertVal, ExtremalVal]
[Linked List]
*AllStructures> recommendAllDS [InsertArgVal, FindByArg ]
[Array,Hashtable]
*AllStructures> recommendAllDS [InsertVal, FindByVal ]
[Red-Black Trees]
*AllStructures> recommendAllDS [InsertArgVal, FindByArg ]
[Array,Hashtable]
